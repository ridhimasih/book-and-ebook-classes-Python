# book-and-ebook-classes-Python
n this task, we designed a class structure to handle both traditional printed books and digital ebooks, focusing on managing book attributes and calculating author royalties with different rules for physical and digital formats.

Hereâ€™s how you can design the Book and Ebook classes in Python, following the problem statement:

Step-by-step explanation:
Book class:

It has the following instance variables: title, author, publisher, price, and royalty.
It has getter and setter methods for these variables.
A royalty() method calculates the royalty for the author based on the number of copies sold with different percentage rates.
Ebook class (inherits from Book):

Adds an additional instance variable format (like EPUB, PDF, etc.).
Overrides the royalty() method to account for the GST deduction on ebooks.
Python Code:
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, publisher, price):
        self._title = title
        self._author = author
        self._publisher = publisher
        self._price = price
        self._copies_sold = 0  # Track number of copies sold

    # Getter and setter properties for title
    @property
    def title(self):
        return self._title

    @title.setter
    def title(self, value):
        self._title = value

    # Getter and setter properties for author
    @property
    def author(self):
        return self._author

    @author.setter
    def author(self, value):
        self._author = value

    # Getter and setter properties for publisher
    @property
    def publisher(self):
        return self._publisher

    @publisher.setter
    def publisher(self, value):
        self._publisher = value

    # Getter and setter properties for price
    @property
    def price(self):
        return self._price

    @price.setter
    def price(self, value):
        self._price = value

    # Getter and setter properties for copies_sold
    @property
    def copies_sold(self):
        return self._copies_sold

    @copies_sold.setter
    def copies_sold(self, value):
        self._copies_sold = value

    # Method to calculate royalty
    def royalty(self):
        royalty_amount = 0
        if self._copies_sold <= 500:
            royalty_amount = 0.10 * self._price * self._copies_sold
        elif self._copies_sold <= 1500:
            royalty_amount = (0.10 * self._price * 500) + (0.125 * self._price * (self._copies_sold - 500))
        else:
            royalty_amount = (0.10 * self._price * 500) + (0.125 * self._price * 1000) + \
                             (0.15 * self._price * (self._copies_sold - 1500))
        return royalty_amount

# Subclass 'Ebook' inherited from 'Book'
class Ebook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, publisher, price, format):
        super().__init__(title, author, publisher, price)
        self._format = format

    # Getter and setter properties for format
    @property
    def format(self):
        return self._format

    @format.setter
    def format(self, value):
        self._format = value

    # Overriding royalty() method for Ebook
    def royalty(self):
        royalty_amount = super().royalty()  # Calculate royalty using parent class method
        gst_deduction = 0.12 * royalty_amount  # GST deduction on ebook
        return royalty_amount - gst_deduction

# Example Usage:
book = Book("Python 101", "John Doe", "TechPress", 1000)
book.copies_sold = 2000
print(f"Royalty for book: {book.royalty()}")

ebook = Ebook("Python 101 - Ebook", "John Doe", "TechPress", 1000, "EPUB")
ebook.copies_sold = 2000
print(f"Royalty for ebook (after GST): {ebook.royalty()}")

Explanation:
The Book class handles the common details such as title, author, publisher, and price.
The royalty() method in Book calculates royalties based on the number of copies sold, following the given rates.
The Ebook class inherits from Book and adds an extra format property.
In Ebook, the royalty() method is overridden to apply a 12% GST deduction on the royalty amount for ebooks.
